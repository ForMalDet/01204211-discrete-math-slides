    In 1202, Leonardo Bonacci (known as Fibonacci) asked the following
    question.

    \begin{tcolorbox}
      {\footnotesize ``[A]ssuming that: a newly born pair of rabbits,
        one male, one female, are put in a field; rabbits are able to
        mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second
        month a female can produce another pair of rabbits; rabbits
        never die and a mating pair always produces one new pair (one
        male, one female) every month from the second month on.''

        ``The puzzle that Fibonacci posed was: how many pairs will
        there be in one year?''}
