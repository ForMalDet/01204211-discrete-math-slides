\lecturetitle{Lecture 17: Primality testing (2)} 

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Efficient algorithms}
  This lecture proves that the two forms of the Fermat's Little
  Theorem are equivalent.  It also considers two efficient algorithms
  for
  \begin{itemize}
  \item computing powers $a^n$,
  \item finding the greatest common divisors.
  \end{itemize}
  These two algorithms will be useful for our primality testing
  algorithm based on the Fermat's Little Theorem that we shall outline
  at the end of this lecture.
